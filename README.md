# Automate-Online-Classes
Developed a C program to streamline the process of attending online classes on Google Meet.
This program helps automate the process of joining online classes via Google Meet. Users can input the times of their classes at the start of the day, and the program will automatically open the Google Meet link at the specified times, ensuring you never miss a class.

## Features

- Automatically opens Google Meet links at specified class times.
- Displays the current time continuously.
- Alerts the user when it's time to join a class with a beep sound.

## Prerequisites

- Windows Operating System (due to the use of Windows-specific functions like `Sleep`, `Beep`, and `system("cls")`).
- C compiler (such as GCC).
